# AuraVox Echo Bot - AI Voice Agent Implementation

## Project Overview
This project implements a full non-streaming AI Voice Agent pipeline for Day 9 of the 30 Days of AI Voice Agents challenge. The application includes:

1. Text-to-Speech functionality
2. Echo Bot with two modes (original playback and Murf voice echo)
3. AI Voice Assistant with LLM integration

## Implemented Features

### 1. Backend Implementation (`main.py`)
- Updated the `/llm/query` endpoint to accept both text and audio input
- Implemented audio transcription using AssemblyAI
- Integrated Google Gemini LLM for generating responses
- Added text-to-speech conversion using Murf API
- Implemented error handling for missing API keys and processing failures
- Added 3000-character limit handling for Murf API

### 2. Frontend Implementation

#### HTML Structure (`index.html`)
- Added a new "AI Voice Assistant" section with:
  - Voice selection dropdown
  - Recording status display
  - Start/stop recording buttons
  - Loading indicator with spinner animation
  - Transcription display
  - AI response display
  - Audio player for response playback
  - Audio visualization for recording feedback

#### JavaScript Implementation (`script.js`)
- Added global variables for LLM voice agent functionality
- Implemented event listeners for recording buttons
- Added audio recording and processing logic
- Implemented helper functions:
  - `showLLMStatus`: Displays status messages
  - `processLLMQuery`: Handles audio submission to backend
  - `setupLLMAudioVisualization`: Sets up audio visualization
  - `visualizeLLMAudio`: Renders real-time audio waveform
  - `stopLLMAudioVisualization`: Stops visualization when recording ends
- Added voice selector population from Murf API

### 3. Audio Visualization
- Implemented real-time audio waveform display during recording
- Added canvas element for visualization
- Created frequency analyzer to process audio data
- Added gradient styling for waveform bars

## User Experience Improvements
- Visual feedback during recording with audio waveform
- Clear status messages throughout the process
- Loading indicators during processing
- Organized UI sections for different functionalities

## Technical Implementation Details

### Audio Processing Pipeline
1. User clicks "Ask Question" button
2. Microphone access is requested
3. Audio is recorded while visualization shows waveform
4. Recording is sent to backend
5. Audio is transcribed using AssemblyAI
6. Transcription is sent to Google Gemini LLM
7. LLM response is converted to audio using Murf
8. Audio response is played back to user

### Audio Visualization Implementation
- Uses Web Audio API's AnalyserNode
- Processes frequency data in real-time
- Renders bars on canvas element
- Updates at animation frame rate
- Automatically starts/stops with recording

## Future Enhancements
- Streaming audio response for more natural conversation
- Improved error handling and recovery
- Additional voice options
- Voice activity detection for automatic recording stop
- Sentiment analysis for more contextual responses
